# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation and release notes.

## Structure

- **release-notes/** - Contains the project's changelog and release notes
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - Full project changelog generated by standard-version

## Release Process

Release notes are automatically generated when using the release commands:

```bash
npm run release:patch  # 0.2.13 → 0.2.14
npm run release:minor  # 0.2.13 → 0.3.0
npm run release:major  # 0.2.13 → 1.0.0
npm run release        # Automatic version bump based on commits
```

The release notes in `release-notes/CHANGELOG.md` are updated automatically based on conventional commits following the format defined in `.versionrc.json`.
